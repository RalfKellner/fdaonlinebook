    "In the cell below you can see how a csv file is read in using pandas. This works very similarly for txt files. Depending on how the data in the file is separated (e.g. space, comma, etc.), this must be explicitly specified when reading the file. For more detailed help on this, use the *help(pd.read_csv)* call. You can download the file from this example (then with current data) relatively easily yourself under this [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DAX/history?p=DAX) by clicking on the download button.

This may seem like a lot, but in some cases it is not. In addition, it is often better to be able to structure data in a somewhat more complex form. For this purpose, databases can be used to retrieve data by means of a \"query language\". One of the best known languages for this purpose (for relational databases) is Structured Query Language - SQL. With this language specific values can be retrieved from the database by single commands. To give you a small example, the next three cells show how data can be written to a database and retrieved."

Using pandas you can quickly and easily convert the data into a dataset that is easy to analyze."

    "## Collecting financial data with yahoo finance\n",
    "\n",
    "We are particluarly interested in financial data in this course. Most data providers for financial data are not free of charge. This is why we access data of the [yahoo finance homepage](https://finance.yahoo.com/) in this course to gather financial data which comes without any costs. However, one limitation which you should be aware of, is that yahoo finance does not provide data for companies which have been delisted of financial markets in the past. This introduces a surviorship bias into our data because the reason for delisting is usually related to a deterioration of the company's business. Thus, examining only surving companies may draw a too optimistic picture of the stock market's performance. Nevertheless, this is more of an issue if you would like to backtest investment real-life investment strategies and not too disadvantageous for our course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yahoo finance provides access to its data by a free API. However, its API is a bit complex, so we prefer to use a Python package directly that pulls data via the public API, but offers user-friendly features.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Note: After changes in the home page structure or in case of connection problems, there may be problems despite correct code when referring via the yfinance package. If you get error messages with the code of the course when using this package, please contact me.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to obtain data or information on individual companies via the package, it is important to know the ticker or symbol of the company. The ticker is the abbreviation of the company name under which the companies are traded on stock exchanges. The easiest way to find the ticker is to search for the company on the yahoo finance page. In most cases, the ticker is displayed immediately. If you enter the company name Apple in the search bar, the suggestion \"AAPL\" appears immediately, which is the ticker. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of this [documentation](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) you can get an impression of which data can be obtained. For example, past balance sheets, income statements or current news are available. Depending on the source of information, a suitable data format is selected.  "
